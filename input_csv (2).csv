"HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is ""barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece´s exit ""almost inevitable"" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be ""manageable"", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006.

"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

"SYDNEY: Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after the World Bank cut its economic growth forecast, helping extend a rout that saw prices touch a nearly six-year low the previous session.Oil and other commodities came under pressure after the weaker outlook from the Washington-based financial institution reinforced worries of a gloomy economic outlook at a time when oil markets are plagued by oversupply.""The global economy is running on a single engine ... the American one,"" World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said. ""This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.""February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1 was at $45.29, down 60 cents.""There's clearly a souring of sentiment towards industrial commodities and I think that's spilling over to oil today,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.""Potentially this selling is now being overdone, but today there's no sign of a turnaround,"" he said.Analysts said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent, and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said. The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.""Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,"" analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.""The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,"" ANZ bank said.

"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) on Friday approved export of 1.2 million tons of wheat and imposed a bans on import of wheat byproducts. Federal Minister for Finance Senator Ishaq Dar chaired the meeting and approved the export of 1.2 million tons of wheat out of the surplus stocks available in Punjab and Sindh.Accordingly, Punjab will export 800,000 tons while Sindh has been allocated export quota of 400,000 tons of wheat. Punjab will get a subsidy of Rs55 per metric ton for export while for Sindh this subsidy would be Rs45 per metric ton.Taking notice of unhindered import of wheat byproducts, the ECC also issued instructions for immediate ban on their import.The ECC considered a proposal moved by the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron) and approved the provision of 30,000 tons of wheat to the United Nations World Food Programme for distribution among Temporarily Displaced Persons (TDPs), catering for the period up to March 2015.The ECC also observed that in case of further requirements, Safron could revert to the forum with a fresh proposal.The ECC considered and approved a proposal by the Water and Power Minstry to attract private sector investment in transmission line projects with the inclusion of upfront tariff as an option. The ECC also accorded approval for the extension of GSA between OGDCL and Fauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited (FKPCL) for provision of 20 mmcfd of gas at the earliest but not later than February 1. Till that time, LNG is made available to the company for power generation. At its maximum generation capacity utilisation, the plant will generate 157 MW of electricity.The ECC approved Issuance of Policy directive to NEPRA to build in costs incurred by the power sector into the tariff without affecting the end consumer.The committee also approved the re-lending of the buyer credit loan to PAEC as per actual terms and conditions available to the Government of Pakistan. Based on the above approval, the revised rate comes to nine per cent comprising actual cost of loan and exchange rate risk.

"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014. [O/R]""This little spike in prices is understandable... It should be sold off quickly and it won't last long at all,"" said Mark Keenan, an analyst at Societe Generale.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.

"ISLAMABAD: In a move to give relief to consumers, sources in the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday that the price of petrol and petroleum products are expected to decrease further from February 1.According to sources, the price of petrol is expected to be slashed by Rs 10 per litre, High Speed Diesel by Rs 8.50 per litre, Light Diesel by Rs 11 per litre, HOBC by Rs 14 per litre, and Kerosene by Rs 12 per litre.Global crude oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since June 2014, and to provide consistent relief to consumers, the Pakistan government has decreased the price of petrol by Rs 29 since the last four months and brought the price of Diesel down by Rs 23 in the same time frame.Fuel crisis in the country began last week when Pakistan State Oil (PSO) was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil.The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps.

"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate. The market is in a risk-on mode.""The euro plunged to as low as $1.1098 at one point in Asia Monday, the lowest level since September 2003, before recovering later in the day to close out in New York at $1.1234.On Tuesday in Asia it bought $1.1250.It also sank to 131.55 yen Monday in Asia before bouncing to end the day at 133.12 yen. It bought 133.31 yen in Tokyo Tuesday.The dollar edged up to 118.47 yen from 118.49 yen in US trade.Oil prices edged up slightly after falling to fresh six-year lows Monday, despite a warning from the OPEC cartel that prices could punch $200 owing to shrinking investment in exploration.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for March delivery rose five cents to $45.20 while Brent crude for March gained 13 cents to $48.29.Gold fetched $1,276.39 an ounce, against $1,281.39 late Monday.

"New York: Oil prices rebounded Tuesday from six-year lows as the dollar weakened after disappointing US economic data.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for March delivery, rose $1.08 (2.4 percent) to close at $45.16 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for March settled at $49.60 a barrel in London, up $1.44 from Monday´s closing level.""The market has found a bottom in the mid-40 range,"" said Kyle Cooper of IAF Advisors.Crude futures sank Monday to their lowest closing levels since early 2009. Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didn´t see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""It´s too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. ""I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.""Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world´s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.

It is also above monthly data since April 1931.""It´s not a pretty picture,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. ""We´re seeking bottom but I don´t think we´re there yet.""The oil market has collapsed by more than 50 percent since June, plagued by plentiful crude supplies, weak global demand and the decision of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to let prices fall.""If proof were needed that oil prices remain constrained by too much supply, this afternoon´s US inventory data confirmed it,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.""As such, prices could well have further to fall with prospects of a drop below $40 a barrel becoming a reality in the short to medium term.""

"strong>LAHORE: Left arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who was banned for five years from International cricket in spot-fixing case, has returned to the national squad announced for upcoming New Zealand tour.</strongMohammad Amir has been included in One-Day International and Twenty20 squads.Chief selector Haroon Rasheed announced that Mohammad Amir, Ahmed Shahzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Emad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Amir Yamin, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Mohammad Rizwan, and Saad Nasim will be part of the T20 team.The ODI squad comprises Ahmed Shahzad, Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Asad Shafiq, Babar Azam, Sohaib Maqsood, Zafar Gohar, Emad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Rizwan, and Mohammad Amir.Rasheed said that Amir's case has been forwarded to the New Zealand consulate and that his visa process will begin after the New Year's holidays.Amir, 23, resumed his career in March playing grade two cricket in Pakistan, after the ICC allowed his early return to cricket. He moved onto grade one and caught further attention in the Bangladesh Premier League where he picked up 14 wickets in nine matches at an average of 12.64."
"strong>SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Year´s test starting this weekend.</strongAn inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australia´s victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner O´Keefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.O´Keefe´s inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican."
"strong>SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.</strongSmith finished his annus mirabilis as the world´s top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australia´s best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australia´s highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australia´s copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lord´s.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this week´s third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.""It´s a huge motivation, that´s what we want to be, number one in all formats and we´re working extremely hard to get there,"" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.""It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. It´s been a good summer for us so far, so we´d like to finish on a high.""Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, February´s two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smith´s side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smith´s side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.""Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think that´s one of the big things we´re going to be judged on,"" Smith added.""It´s going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but I´m confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.""Smith´s own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australia´s only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.""I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again,"" Smith said.""All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.""Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week."
"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given “the benefit of the doubt” and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.“He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program,” McCullum said.“If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster,” added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.“He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended),” White said.“He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.“I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing,” added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week."
"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow tore apart the South African bowling attack as they enjoyed a run feast at Newlands on a record-breaking second day of the second Test which led to England declaring their first innings on 629 for six.South Africa were 24 for one wicket in reply at tea with a 605-run deficit.Stokes amassed 258 runs and Bairstow an unbeaten 150 as they bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket Test record of 399 runs.Stokes notched up the quickest 250 (off 196 balls) in Test history after scoring the second fastest double century (163 balls) in a knock that lasted 198 deliveries, which included 30 fours and a England record 11 sixes.Bairstow notched an emotional first test century, with England declaring once he got to 150 off 191 balls with 18 fours and two sixes.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable one and half sessions of devastating batting before putting the dispirited-looking home side into bat.Stokes´ double century took 10 balls more than New Zealand´s Nathan Astle, who holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls. England´s previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwag´s record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africa´s horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes scored the second fastest double century in Tests and led a run feast on the second day of the second Test against South Africa by battering the home attack to take England to 513 for five wickets at lunch.Stokes (204 not out) and Jonny Bairstow, who was unbeaten on 95, bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket record stand for England.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable session that produced 196 runs in two hours of devastating batting.Stokes´ double century came off 163 balls with 26 fours and seven sixes.New Zealand´s Nathan Astle holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls while England´s previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.Stokes now holds the record score for an England number six, beating Graham Hick´s 187 against India in 1993, and became the first English centurion at Newlands for 50 years.He produced an array of astonishing boundaries, bringing up his 200 by pulling Morne Morkel for a four and leaving the home side looking dispirited in the field on another hot day in Cape Town.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first Test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs.The tourists began Sunday´s play like they were playing a Twenty20 match with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century and did not let up after that.Bairstow brought up his 50 soon after -- his fourth in five innings against South Africa -- as the pair picked up the pace with 102 runs in the first hour´s play.The South African bowling attack, without injured Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, had their figures hammered with debutant Chris Morris going to lunch having conceded 141 runs for his single wicket.Kagiso Rabada was 3-123 and spinner Dane Piedt 0-112. Lead bowler Morne Morkel´s figures were 1-102. (Reuters) "
"SYDNEY: Australia´s spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather-disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday.More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop-start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start.Denesh Ramdin, unbeaten on 23, and Carlos Brathwaite (35 not out) will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away.The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and O´Keefe got plenty of turn off a straw-coloured wicket.Off-spinner Lyon (2-68) produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwood´s off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85.Left-arm orthodox spinner O´Keefe (1-42) then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil.Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne, West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test.After the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australia´s bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravo´s miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the opener´s glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip. (Reuters) "
"CAPE TOWN: Captain Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century on the third day of the second Test against England and AB de Villiers made 88 as South Africa reached tea on 290 for three on Monday.Amla scored his first hundred for more than a year and De Villiers reached 8,000 Test runs before he pulled a short ball from Steven Finn to James Anderson at mid-wicket just before the interval.South Africa trailed the touring side by 339 runs, 140 short of avoiding the follow-on, with Amla on 132 not out and Faf du Plessis on 15.Amla and De Villiers resumed on 141 for two and extended their partnership to 183, giving South Africa a foothold in the game after England declared on a massive total of 629 for six on a second day of record-breaking batting.The experienced pair played with much circumspection but did offer chances.<br/> Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.<br/> (Reuters) "
"SYDNEY: Carlos Brathwaite shone briefly for West Indies but the rain was the only real winner on Monday as wet weather washed away all but 11.2 overs of play on the second day of the third Test against Australia.West Indies were 248 for seven in their first innings when the rain interrupted play for the third and final time half an hour after lunch in the wake of Brathwaite´s dismissal for 69.Play was officially abandoned at 4:35 p.m.(0535 GMT) as the rain continued to cascade down on Sydney Cricket Ground with the 14,266 optimistic souls who came through the gates despite the gloomy forecast offered a full refund.That meant that the flurry of boundaries with which Brathwaite lit up the few overs of action was ultimately a free show and the 27-year-old was warmly applauded for it by an appreciative crowd.Resuming on 35 with his team on 207 for six, the tall, muscular Bajan showed why he has been one of the few bright spots for West Indies on what has otherwise been a miserable tour.Playing his second Test after scoring 59 on debut in Melbourne last week, Brathwaite smashed four sixes and seven fours in his 71-ball innings.One of the two sixes he hit in one over off Australia paceman James Pattinson was a spectacular heave over the covers and deep into the crowd.A fuming Pattinson had his revenge, however, when he found his range and took out Brathwaite´s off stump with what the batsman described as a ""good nut"".""I was upset that once again I got a start and couldn´t carry on. One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize,"" Brathwaite said.""Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said ´you know what, just enjoy the feeling´. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.""Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

"strong>CAPE TOWN: Jonny Bairstow pumped his chest to the sky and wiped away a tear as he completed an emotional maiden test hundred for England against South Africa on Sunday, amid a record-breaking stand with Ben Stokes.</strongThe red-haired England wicketkeeper last year lost his grandfather, with whom he shared a close relationship, while his dad David, a former England cricketer, killed himself in 1998.“Obviously after everything that has gone on in the last year or so it’s fantastic to get over the line for me and my family,” he told reporters after finishing on 150 not out with his mother and sister watching on from the stands. “They have supported me all through my career. To have them here in Cape Town is lovely and it is my mum’s birthday on the last day of the test so hopefully we can cap off a great game. “It was probably the best day of my life and one I will never forget.”After being recalled to the England side during last year’s Ashes triumph over Australia, Bairstow's place in the team has come under scrutiny. ""It has been a little while coming. There was a lot of talk here and there so I’m delighted to get over the line today,” he said.Stokes and Bairstow scored 399 in a record sixth-wicket stand as England declared on 629 for six on the second day of the second test at Newlands.It was a bludgeoning performance from Stokes, who scored a record-breaking 258 off 198 balls.""It was an exhibition of stroke play,"" Bairstow said. ""We just clicked in and supported each other all the way through. To play a knock like that is something quite spectacular.“I’ve grown up with Stokesy and seen him play some fantastic knocks and to witness that today was extremely special and something a lot of people will never forget.” England will seek to take an even firmer hold on the test on Monday by quickly dismissing South Africa, who closed on 141 for two.""It will be a strong move from us if we can come back in the morning and take some chances,"" Bairstow said. “Our bowlers have a wealth of experience in all different conditions and hopefully we can come out tomorrow, utilise a bit of reverse swing, moisture in the pitch and we go from there."""
"CAPE TOWN: England grabbed three wickets in 23 balls to inject life back into the second Test but any hopes they had of skittling South Africa out were ended by Temba Bavuma on Tuesday.The young batsman scored an unbeaten 52 to take South Africa to 525 for six at tea on the fourth day, trailing England by 104 runs with four session left in the match.Chris Morris, making his debut, was unbeaten on 24 in an unbroken 76-run partnership.South Africa batted slowly in the morning as they chipped away at England´s massive first-innings score of 629 for six declared.Hashim Amla reached his double century before the new ball after lunch brought a breakthrough when Stuart Broad bowled the hosts´ captain for 201.Faf du Plessis fell three balls later after making 86 off 216 balls, edging a low catch to Ben Stokes at third slip off the bowling of James Anderson.Quinton de Kock, back in the side after missing the last four Tests, fell for a trap set for him as he pulled a ball from Broad straight to Anderson at short square leg.Bavuma played an array of attacking strokes to race to his fifty off 52 balls with Morris playing a good supporting role.Amla effectively played his side back into the Test series with his patient innings which took almost 12 hours and included 27 fours.Dropped twice on Monday, an otherwise unflappable Amla betrayed nerves on 197, skying a shot and watching anxiously as Joe Root misjudged the ball and failed to get close to it.South Africa were 353 for three overnight and had made it clear they wanted to keep England in the field for much of the day again in baking-hot temperatures, well over 30 degrees Celsius.England lead the four-match series 1-0.

"strong>ZURICH: Banned European soccer boss Michel Platini has withdrawn his candidacy from the race for the presidency of soccer's scandal-plagued governing body FIFA, he told French sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday.</strongPlatini, the head of European soccer body UEFA, was handed an eight-year ban from the game along with outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter by the federation's independent Ethics Committee on Dec. 21.Both have been engulfed by the worst corruption scandal in FIFA's history as the sport faces criminal investigations in Switzerland and the United States, where 41 soccer officials and sports entities have been indicted on corruption-related charges.Former French international Platini has insisted he has done nothing wrong and was still hoping to win an appeal in time to have been allowed back in time for the election on Feb. 26., but said he had changed his mind.""I withdraw my candidacy. I can no longer (go through with it). I have neither the time, nor the means to go and see the voters, to meet people, and to fight with others,"" he said in an interview which L'Equipe published on its website.""By withdrawing, I chose to fully focus on my defence on a case where there's no talk of corruption, falsification anymore, in which there's nothing left.""It's a matter of schedule, but it's not just that. How do you win an election when you're prevented from campaigning?""Blatter and Platini were both banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) made to the Frenchman by FIFA with Blatter's approval in 2011 for work done a decade earlier.The committee said the payment, made at a time when Blatter was seeking re-election, lacked transparency and presented conflicts of interest, though both men denied wrongdoing.Platini had initially been seen as the favourite to replace Blatter in the Feb. 26 election where each of 209 national football associations who are members of FIFA hold one vote.""I had... about hundred of official letters of support from federations and about 50 pledges, in two days,"" Platini said.Five candidates, none of them clear favourites, will take part in the election and a chance for the job of rebuilding the sport's beleaguered governing body.They are Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, former FIFA official Jerome Champagne of France, UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino of Switzerland and South Africa businessman Tokyo Sexwale.Infantino has been Platini's right-hand man at UEFA and announced his candidacy after the Frenchman had been initially suspended in October.Champagne, although a compatriot of Platini, is known to be a critic, has no connections with UEFA and says that FIFA's priority must be to spread the game's riches more evenly around the world."

"MELBOURNE: Former golden girl Eugenie Bouchard is heading into the Australian Open with ""zero expectations"" of success after a year plagued by injury and poor form.Following a breakout year in 2014, the Canadian tumbled out of the top 10 with first round exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.Worse was to come, with a dramatic locker room fall leaving her concussed and forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open, an incident which prompted the former world number five to sue the United States Tennis Association (USTA).After three months away from the tour, Bouchard made a positive return at Shenzhen last week, winning her first two matches before being beaten in the quarter-finals.She continues her preparations for the Australian Open at the Hobart International this week but was playing down her prospects of a return to winning ways in the immediate future.""A month or two ago I wasn´t even sure I could play the Australian Open so I´m just so happy to be in Australia, looking forward to playing these two tournaments (with) zero expectations,"" the 21-year-old told reporters on Sunday.""I´m feeling good. I didn´t want to play if I wasn´t somewhat prepared, so I worked really hard in the off season to try and catch up a bit.""Returning at Shenzhen was a relief for the Canadian, whose run to the 2014 Wimbledon final and the Australian and French semi-finals in the same year saw her touted as a future world number one.""To step on the court and play a full match with no pain, play three matches three days in a row, was a success for me even though I lost the last match,"" said Bouchard, now ranked 49th in the world after peaking at five in Oct. 2014.Bouchard will face American Bethanie Mattek-Sands in the first round in Hobart.

"BRISBANE: An inspired Milos Raonic toppled Roger Federer 6-4 6-4 to win the Brisbane International on Sunday and avenge his defeat to the Swiss master in last year´s final.Raonic unleashed his usual serving blitz but it was the rangy Canadian´s groundstrokes that impressed the most as he outwitted the Swiss with a masterful display of clean hitting from the baseline.Federer, irrepressible in his semi-final win over Dominic Thiem, was off-colour from the start at Pat Rafter Arena and his 25-year-old opponent feasted repeatedly on his wayward backhand.Beaten in three tight sets last year, Raonic won at a canter in the rematch to clinch his eighth tour title and complete the perfect buildup to his bid for a maiden grand slam at the Australian Open starting later this month.Closing out the match with a booming first serve that Federer could only parry long, Raonic roared in triumph, having beaten the 17-times grand slam champion for only the second time in 11 encounters.He accepted the winner´s trophy from 77-year-old Australian great Rod Laver, the only player to complete the calendar grand slam twice.Long tipped to rock the tennis establishment, Raonic showed a bullet-proof poise in response to his opponent´s frustration and broke Federer´s serve in the ninth game of the opening set.Federer blasted a forehand long to concede the set then blew a gilt-edged chance to break Raonic early in the second by spraying a backhand long.Missing a regulation forehand winner down the line, Federer gave up a break-point and Raonic captured the decisive break in the eighth game.Federer battled hard to put the set back on level terms, but Raonic´s thunderbolt serve proved to be impenetrable.(Reuters) "
"AUCKLAND:  Colin Munro blasted New Zealand´s fastest Twenty20 half century to surpass a mark set by Martin Guptill earlier in the innings as the hosts swept their two-match series against Sri Lanka with a nine-wicket win in Auckland on Sunday.Guptill first rewrote the record books when he took just 19 deliveries to bring up his eighth half century in the shortest form of the game before he was eventually dismissed for 63 after smashing six boundaries and five sixes.His mark was then eclipsed by Munro some 20 minutes later when the left hander hit his seventh six to take New Zealand to 147 for one, the hosts chasing down Sri Lanka´s 142-8 total at Eden Park in just 10 overs.Munro´s half century came off 14 balls, the second fastest in international cricket behind India´s Yuvraj Singh (12 balls).He hit one four along with his seven maximums to finish unbeaten on exactly 50.The 2-0 series defeat also ensured Sri Lanka, the 2014 World Twenty20 champions, were replaced by West Indies at the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 rankings.Sri Lanka´s innings had been held together by Test and one-day captain Angelo Mathews´ 81 not out, his highest score in the format, while opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a streaky 28.No other batsmen got into double figures.As in most of the limited overs matches on the tour, Sri Lanka´s top order failed to get their innings going, slumping to 39-3 in the seventh over.Their normally reliable, and deep, middle order also failed to capitalise on Eden Park´s small boundaries as New Zealand´s bowlers varied their pace, line, length and flight, with part-time medium pacer Grant Elliott taking 4-22.The sixth Twenty20 World Cup takes place in India from March 8 to April 3.

"PERTH: Captain Steve Smith and George Bailey struck fluent centuries as Australia chased down a steep 310-run target to win the first one-day international against India by five wickets in Perth on Tuesday.Smith fell for his highest ODI score of 149 with Australia two runs short of victory and the right-hander left the ground shaking his head before watching his team seal victory with four balls to spare.Opener Rohit Sharma smashed an unbeaten 171 to lift India to 309 for three after the touring side won the toss and chose to bat first in sublime batting conditions at the WACA ground.India lost Shikhar Dhawan (nine) early but Rohit, the only cricketer with two double centuries in this format, and test captain Virat Kohli (91) laid the platform for a late flourish with a 207-run stand for the second wicket.India left-arm paceman Barinder Sran (3-56) gave his side a dream start on his debut by dismissing hard-hitting openers Aaron Finch (eight) and David Warner (five) in successive overs to reduce Australia to 21 for two.But Bailey (112) scored his third ODI hundred and added 242 for the third wicket with his skipper to take the match away from India.Bailey was lucky to survive an appeal for caught behind on the first ball he faced with television replays confirming Bran´s delivery brushing his glove on the way through to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India also missed several opportunities to run the right-hander out when their throws failed to hit the stumps.Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin sent back Bailey and Glenn Maxwell (six) in successive overs to give India hope but it was too little, too late.The 28-year-old Rohit, whose 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014 remains the highest individual score in the 50-over format, hit 13 fours and seven sixes.Rohit´s 163-ball knock was the highest score by a visiting batsman against Australia, overtaking West Indies great Viv Richards´s unbeaten 153 in 1979 in Melbourne.Kohli fell in unselfish manner trying to score quickly for his team and was out caught close to the boundary rope by Aaron Finch off paceman James Faulkner, who finished with figures of 2-60 in his 10 overs. "

Who will win it? You know as well as I do that it’s certainly Messi who will win it. I think so. Overall I’m not a big fan of that,"" the Frenchman said earlier on Monday.The breakdown presented by FIFA also revealed tactical voting among the 165 national team coaches, 162 national team captains and 171 media representatives who cast votes.Messi, eligible to vote as Argentina captain, named Barcelona team mates Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta as his top three.Portugal captain Ronaldo choose three Real Madrid team mates -- Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.Belgium captain Vincent Kompany opted for his compatriots Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne as his top two.More surprisingly, Spain captain Iker Casillas -- the former Real Madrid goalkeeper who now plays for Portuguese club Porto -- was among those who did not vote.Despite a red carpet and plenty of glitz, the event had a low-key air of predictability about it and was held against the backdrop of FIFA going through the worst corruption crisis since it was founded in 1904.The sport is facing criminal investigations in both Switzerland and the United States, where some leading FIFA officials are among 41 individuals and sports entities who have been indicted on corruption charges.Outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter, normally a central figure in the ceremony, was not involved after being banned for eight years by the Ethics Committee in December and there was no President's Award, usually given out by Blatter for outstanding services to the game.Past recipients have included Pele, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the Haiti national team, Queen Rania of Jordan and South African anti-apartheid activist and veteran cleric, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.Acting president Issa Hayatou played a low-key role, reading a brief speech before the start and appearing on stage when the awards for best player and women's player were presented.Ronaldo said the players did not want to discuss FIFA's problems.""We avoid answering this kind of question,"" he told a press conference before the ceremony.""We are professional football players, we compete every week, every day, we train and we just focus on that. These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.""In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53."
